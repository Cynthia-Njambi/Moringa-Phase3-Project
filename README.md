# Overview
This project focuses on predicting the functionality of water pumps in Tanzania using a large dataset provided by Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. The goal is to assist NGOs and the Tanzanian government in identifying critical factors that influence pump functionality, enabling them to make informed decisions on maintenance and new installations.

# Business & Data Understanding
### Stakeholders
- Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): Involved in providing support for well repairs across Tanzania.
- Government of Tanzania (Ministry of Water): Seeks to understand patterns in non-functional wells to improve the planning and construction of new water points.

### Data Overview
- The dataset comprises 59,400 water points, making it robust for training predictive models.
- Features include numerical, categorical, and geographical data, providing a comprehensive view of factors affecting pump functionality.
- The primary target variable is status_group, which categorizes pumps as either functional, non-functional, or functional but needing repairs.

### Target Variable Distribution
   - **Functional Pumps:** 54.3% (32,259)
   - **Non-Functional Pumps:** 38.4% (22,824)
   - **Functional but Needs Repair:** 7.3% (4,317)

   **Insight:** A significant portion of pumps are non-functional or require repairs, highlighting the importance of early maintenance intervention.
